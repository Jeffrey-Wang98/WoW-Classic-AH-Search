# CS361-Project

A web app that calls TSM API and Blizzard API to generate a table of items from WoW WotLK Classic and the prices of those items in specific realms
and factions. 

Have node v.16+ installed and run npm install to get all packages used.

.env files for both ui and api are needed. Use different ports for both. The .env file for the api portion requires your own BATTLE_NET_CLIENT_ID,
BATTLE_NET_CLIENT_SECRET, and TSM_CLIENT_ID. You can get these from https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/getting-started for the battl.net client
ID and secret, and tradeskillmaster.com's my profile page after creating an account.
